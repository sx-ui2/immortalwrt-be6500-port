/*
 * mqtt_eloop.h - libmosquitto direct eloop integration for hostapd
 *
 * Integrates libmosquitto with hostapd's eloop:
 * no background thread — mosquitto_socket() fd is registered directly
 * with eloop_register_read_sock(), and mosquitto_loop_read/write/misc()
 * are called from eloop callbacks.
 *
 * Threading model: ALL callbacks (on_message, on_connect, on_disconnect)
 * run in the hostapd main thread, called from mosquitto_loop_read() inside
 * the eloop read handler. No mutex or synchronization is required.
 *
 * Reconnect: on unexpected disconnect, the old socket fd is unregistered
 * from eloop, and mosquitto_reconnect_async() is retried via an eloop
 * timer with exponential backoff. The new fd returned by
 * mosquitto_socket() after reconnect is re-registered automatically.

 * @client_id:   MQTT client identifier string (must be unique per broker)
 * @keepalive:   Keepalive interval in seconds (0 → 60)
 * @msg_cb:      Called for each received message (may be NULL)
 *               @topic:      MQTT topic string (NUL-terminated, valid only
 *                            during the callback)

 *               the duration of this callback — copy it if you need to
 *               retain it.
 * @state_cb:    Called on connect/disconnect events (may be NULL)

 *                           false = disconnected (unexpected or graceful)

 *               subscriptions stored via mqtt_eloop_subscribe() have
 *               already been re-sent to the broker.
 * @userdata:    Opaque pointer passed back to both callbacks unchanged
 *
 * Initialises libmosquitto and creates the mosquitto instance. Does NOT
 * connect to the broker — call mqtt_eloop_connect() after this.
 *
 * Returns: Allocated context pointer on success, NULL on failure.
